# Python Machine Learning project

In this repository I cover the material taught in the course Applied Machine Learning in Python which is part of the Applied Data Science in Python taught by the University of Michigan.

I solve the problems introduced in the assignments using datasets provided by the course.

### Tools
To solve problems, which boils down to building and testing ML models I use Python and its libraries:
mostly Pandas and Scikit-learn.
